# 2025-12-30

- Cleaned the repo of pihole references and connected the Traefik role to the main playbook/inventory/docs.
- Implemented the Traefik role with env validation, Docker network creation, config templates, and compose/systemd deployment.
- Added a whoami test app role with Traefik labels and env-driven compose deployment.
- Moved whoami_host to host_vars so each Pi can set its own hostname.
