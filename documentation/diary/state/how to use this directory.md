# How to use the state directory

- Every day, before doing anything else, create a file named with the date in the format yyyy-mm-dd.md.
- The heading on that file should be # State for yyyy-mm-dd.
- On that file, before finishing the work for the day, create a list and add an item for each significant status of the project.
- Indicate what is working, what is not working, and if there are any plans to approach what is not working.
