## Current Status

- ADRs document the intended revamp direction for naming and name resolution.
- Traefik usage is defined as opt-in per service (decision matrix ADR).
- `TRAEFIK_ENABLED=true|false` is available in `.env` to toggle Traefik deployment from this repo.
- ADR documents the plan to support multiple TLS strategies (mkcert for LAN, ACME for public VPS) via `TRAEFIK_TLS_MODE`.
- Work is pending to implement `SITE_DOMAIN` and `NAME_RESOLUTION_MODE` in code and inventory patterns.
- Canonical “how-to” docs for apps and Pi-hole integration notes now live under `documentation/`.

## Next Steps

- Add `SITE_DOMAIN` and `NAME_RESOLUTION_MODE` to `.env.example` and document them.
- Refactor host/service FQDNs to be derived from `service.box.domain` instead of hardcoded strings.
- Add a script (or playbook) to generate a client `/etc/hosts` snippet from inventory when `NAME_RESOLUTION_MODE=hosts`.
- Add DNS preflight checks for `NAME_RESOLUTION_MODE=dns` (validate required names resolve before deploy/verify).
