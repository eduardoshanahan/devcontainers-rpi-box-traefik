## Current Status

- Documentation is consolidated under `documentation/` and links are updated.
- Launchers are consistent (`launch.sh` delegates to `editor-launch.sh`).

## Next Steps

- Decide whether remaining top-level docs (for example `ca-share-instructions.md`) should also be removed in favor of the `documentation/` copies.
- Run a quick pass over `documentation/diary/` to reconcile any “(from lm)” duplicates if you want a single canonical “how to use this directory” page.
