# How to use the lm directory

- Before starting to work from fresh, read all the files in the directory.
- In each subdirectory, there are files named by the date when the work was done.
- Each day we work we will have a new file in each directory.
- *state* indicates the current status of the project. What works and what needs more work. Before stopping the work for the day, we need to indicate what is the status of the project.
- *plans* is what we are planning to achieve during the day, and maybe how we plan to achieve it. If the plan changes during the day, the file needs to be updated.
- *recap* is what we were doing at each significant point in time. When we complete a step, we need to recap what we did and what happened.
- The objective of these directories and files is that if a new team starts working on the project, they will have full context of what we did before, and what we want to do. That context needs to be as complete as possible to not waste time and resources.
- Before starting the work of the day, each directory needs to have a file named for it and with content if it is relevant at the start of the day.
