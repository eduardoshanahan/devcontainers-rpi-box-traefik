# 2026-01-10

- Moved the old `lm/` journal content into `documentation/diary/` and cleaned up duplicates.
- Updated documentation files taken from another project to match this repo’s scope (Traefik/apps deployment, not base provisioning).
- Consolidated canonical docs under `documentation/` and removed root copies where appropriate; updated `README.md` links.
- Normalized the launch scripts by making `launch.sh` a wrapper for `editor-launch.sh`.
- Removed an emoji from diary documentation to match `agents.md` markdown standards.
