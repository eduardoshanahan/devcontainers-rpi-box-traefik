# How to use the recap directory

- Every day, before doing anything else, create a file named with the date in the format yyyy-mm-dd.md.
- The heading on that file should be # Recap for yyyy-mm-dd.
- On that file, create a list and add an item each time something significant is achieved.
- If the change is related to the code in the project, include details for another team to recreate them in another project.
