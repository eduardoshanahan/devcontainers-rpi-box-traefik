# 2026-01-11

- Added ADRs to formalize the revamp direction:
  - `service.box.domain` naming scheme with `SITE_DOMAIN` in `.env`.
  - Dual name-resolution modes: `/etc/hosts` now, DNS validation later (`NAME_RESOLUTION_MODE=hosts|dns`).
  - DNS server/record management kept out of this repo.
  - Fail-fast preconditions for FQDN inputs and DNS resolution (when in DNS mode).
- Updated `documentation/README.md` to include the new ADRs.
- Added an ingress decision-matrix ADR to keep Traefik deployment intentional (opt-in).
- Added `TRAEFIK_ENABLED=true|false` (in `.env`) and gated Traefik-related deployment and smoke checks on it.
- Decided to keep a single repo for LAN and VPS targets by introducing a future `TRAEFIK_TLS_MODE` switch (mkcert vs ACME).
- Moved `add-app-via-traefik.md` and `pihole-traefik-instructions.md` under `documentation/` and removed the redundant root copies.
