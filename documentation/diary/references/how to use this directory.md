# How to use the references directory

- If there are any references that are valuable to keep, being them the result of any research, or conversation, or document retrieved from any origin, create a directory named like the day when the reference was found in the format yyyy-mm-dd.
- Create files in that directory with the content of the reference, or links to it.
- Create as many files as are needed.
