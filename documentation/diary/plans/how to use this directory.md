# How to use the plans directory

- Every day, before doing anything else, create a file named with the date in the format yyyy-mm-dd.md.
- The heading on that file should be # Plans for yyyy-mm-dd.
- On that file, create a list with the implementation intentions for the day.
- If there are changes of plans during the day, update this file with the new or modified intentions.
