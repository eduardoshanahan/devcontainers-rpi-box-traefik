# Raspberry Pi Traefik (Docker + Ansible)

This repo deploys Traefik to Raspberry Pi hosts that have already been
provisioned by the [rpi-box project](https://github.com/eduardoshanahan/devcontainers-rpi-box). It is designed to run inside a similar devcontainer workflow and focus only on the Traefik reverse-proxy stack.

## Quick Start

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then run `./launch.sh`.
2. Reopen in container (VS Code/Cursor/Antigravity) to use the preconfigured Ansible tools.
3. Configure inventory + host vars for your Pi.
4. Run the apps playbook: `ansible-playbook src/playbooks/pi-apps.yml -l rpi_box_01`.
